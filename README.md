## Problem
Women's safety is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed in today's society. Women often face the fear of being harassed, stalked, or attacked while travelling, which can have a significant impact on their mental and physical well-being. They often hesitate to travel alone, especially during late hours or to unfamiliar places. There is a need for an app that can help women to feel safe and secure while travelling alone by suggesting the safest route.
## Solution
Our app HerWay, provides women with a safe route feature that can suggest the safest route among all the available routes between source and destination. The app will use modern technologies such as GPS and location-based services to provide real-time location tracking and safe route features.
We propose to design an AI-powered tool that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze safety of a particular area/route by taking into account factors such as time of day, traffic conditions, crime rates in the area, distance from nearest police station while suggesting the safest route. Additional features include:
* Real time location tracking and Ai based vulnerability sensing.
* Emergency contacts, and a SOS button that can be used in case of any danger or emergency.
* A community feature where women can connect with other women in their area. The community feature will allow women to share their experiences, tips, and advice with each other, providing a sense of safety and support.
